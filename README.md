# uC/OS version 1

This is the code I got from the original article describing uC/OS published in 1992.
On the one hand I know it has bugs, on the other hand it is free to use (see the licence). Enjoy. :-)

More information about the OS is in [the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-Controller_Operating_Systems#Writing_applications_under_.CE.BCC.2FOS)

# Motivation

This is a really simple OS: easy to comprehend, code base does not overwhelm, and it is easy to port to small devices.
I hope this code may contribute to someone's understanding of the OS basics and context switching.
